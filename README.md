This repository proposes a self-adaptive ANN model for the classification of rock types for selective mechanical mining. 

The entire code is developed by RX during 2019-2020. 

It requires the Keras library installed with either Theano or Tensorflow as backend. It also requires spectral, NumPy, Scipy, Sklearn, Skimage libraries to be installed for the code to run successfully. There are no specific hardware requirements.

There are two Python files in this repository. 'Lab code.py' is used to train and test the model at the laboratory scale, while 'Field code.py' is employed to train and test the model at the field scale. 

The input data for training and testing of the model are available upon request.
